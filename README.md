# StretchAppStrong
---

*StretchAppStrong* is a _very_ basic (Pebble)[http://getpebble.com] watch application that helps stretch before or after a workout. It keeps track of how long you've been stretching, and sends a pulse when it's time to stop and switch to another stretch, then counts down a short grace period until it's time to start the next stretch. 

## Things you need
1. (Pebble SDK)[http://develop.getpebble.com]
2. This code
3. A (Pebble watch)[http://getpebble.com] helps.
